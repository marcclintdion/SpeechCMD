# SpeechCMD

**Youtube Demo** : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74YJN_XKguw

**Purpose**:
I was inspired by Voice Attach and Vocals, but for fun I wanted to try to make something myself. Originally it was going to be game specific but now
it should be something that can be used for general computing. The app uses the built in Voice recognition and synthesizer that is built into windows, 
along with uses the same virtual keyboard functionality from my other app, OpenKeyboard.

**Feature list**:
 * Execute Application Short Cuts (Quick Keys)
 * Start up an application with a voice command
 * Execute a C# script with a voice command (In Development)
 * Share Command Profiles
 * Portable, so just unzip and run.


### Setup
Just need to setup voice recognition on windows, just follow the instructions from microsoft.
